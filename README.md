# Intelligent-2-Axis-Solar-Tracker-with-Stepper-Motor
Used a 5-volt solar panel to measure the intensity of light by output voltage; used 2 ULN2003 stepper motor drivers to rotate the stepper motor that holds the solar panel and to rotate the stepper motor that holds the 1st stepper motor with the solar panel for an intelligent 2 axis smooth and precise tracking of the sun; used ATmega328P Microcontroller for controlling the stepper motors and to read the solar panel voltage by analog pin; used a LED to indicate the solar power and shown the panel voltage on the serial monitor.</br>
Tools: Programming: C/C++, Hardware: 5V Solar Panel, ULN2003 Motor Driver, Stepper Motor, Arduino UNO, White LED, Battery.</br>
